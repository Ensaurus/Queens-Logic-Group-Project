PROOF 1:

Rt = region- Territories
Tn = Jackets Pack Size- None (No jackets shipped)
Ts = Jackets Pack Size- Small
Tm = Jackets Pack Size- Medium
Tl = Jackets Pack Size- Large
Ssu = Season- Summer
Ssp = Season- Spring

We have conditions that the territories would have jackets all year round, so it is not possible that no jackets are shipped.
We also have a condition that we cannot have medium or large sized shipments of jackets in summer or spring.
Also the shipment has to be empty(no shipment), small , medium or large.
We then prove that in the summer or spring, any store in the territories would get a small shipment of jackets.

PROOF 2:

Swn = Swimwear Pack Size- None (No swimwear shipped)
Sws = Swimwear Pack Size- Small
Swm = Swimwear Pack Size- Medium
Swl = Swimwear Pack Size- Large

P500 = Population >= 500K
P100 = 100K <= Population < 500K
P50 = 50K <= Population < 100K
P20 = 20K <= Population < 50K
P0 = 0 < Population < 20K

Ra = region- Atlantic
Rw = region- west coast(Pacific)
Ssu = Season- Summer
Ssp = Season- Spring

The shipment has to be empty(no shipment), small , medium or large.
The population has to fit in one of the ranges.
A store will get a large pack of swimwear if and only if it has a population greater than 100K.
Any store in the atlantic or pacific region in the summer or spring would get a large or medium shipment.
We prove that in the summer or spring in the coastal regions, any store not serving a population greater than 100K would get a medium pack of swimwear.

PROOF 3:

Bn  = Boots Pack Size - None
Bs  = Boots Pack Size - Small
Bm  = Boots Pack Size - Medium
Bl  = Boots Pack Size - Large

P500 = Population >= 500K
P100 = 100K <= Population < 500K
P50 = 50K <= Population < 100K
P20 = 20K <= Population < 50K
P0 = 0 < Population < 20K

Ra = region- Atlantic
Rw = region- west coast(Pacific)
Rp = region- Prairies
Rc = region- Central
Rt = region- Territories

Ssu = Season- Summer
Ssp = Season- Spring
Sf  = Season- Fall
Sw  = Season- Winter

The shipment has to be empty (no shipment), small , medium or large.
The population has to fit in one of the ranges.
A store will get a large pack of boots if and only if it serves a population greater than 100K and the current season is winter, or, if it's in the Pacific region serving a population
greater than or equal to 50k and the current season isn't summer.
We prove that a store in the Pacific region serving a population of 50k in the Spring will receive a large shipment of boots, while a store serving a population of 100k in the
Atlantic region in the summer will not receive a large shipment of boots.
