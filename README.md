# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project - Group 96

The idea of our project is to model the outgoing warehouse stock of a clothing company to various outlet stores across Canada. The model will receive a number of factors from each store, such as the region being served, the time of the year and the popularity of certain items. It will use these factors to determine the different types and amounts of clothing to send to that store. The goal of this project is to be able to determine with ceratinty how much of a certain clothing item needs to be sent to any store using only the binary logic and the properties of the store given, by dividing the types of clothes exports to be 'small','medium' or 'large' instead of using numerical values.

We haven't restructured our repository, so everything should be accesable from it's default location.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
